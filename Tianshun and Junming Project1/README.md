For this project, I wanted to explore how environmental data could be turned into something more playful and expressive, even if it only exists inside the terminal. Usually, air pollution data is presented as dry numbers or graphs that don’t really connect with people emotionally. I wanted to do the opposite — to make something that feels alive and interactive, something that makes the user react, maybe even smile. I decided to use the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API because it provides real-time data from cities all over the world, which gave me a reason to turn air quality into a kind of journey. The idea was that by typing different city names, users could “travel” virtually and discover how clean or polluted the air is in each place. It’s like a tiny adventure game, but using real data instead of fantasy.

The project is coded entirely in Python and runs completely in the terminal. I used the requests library to connect to the API and get the air quality information, PyFiglet to create the large ASCII banner that gives the project an old-school computer look, and Rich to make the output colorful and animated. When the user enters a city name, the terminal shows a small loading animation that says “Connecting to Air Servers…”, which makes the experience feel more alive. Then the program displays the air quality index (AQI) with a color-coded bar and an emoji that matches the mood. For example, green with 🌿 if the air is clean, yellow with 🌤️ if it’s average, orange with 😷 for slightly polluted, and red with 💀 when the air is really bad. I also added small details like random emojis, different shades of color, and a short delay before showing results to make the interaction feel smoother and less robotic.

I tried to think about this project not just as a coding exercise, but as a creative piece. I wanted to see how far I could push the visual possibilities of a command-line interface — a space that is usually seen as boring or purely technical. It was interesting to realize that even plain text can create atmosphere and emotion through timing, rhythm, and color. In a way, the terminal became a performance space: every time you run the program, it’s like a small show where data, animation, and symbols come together. The randomness of real-time data also adds a feeling of unpredictability, so each run feels slightly different. I think this small project helped me understand that programming can be expressive, not only functional. It reminded me that even with limited tools, like text and color, you can still communicate ideas, humor, and even feelings.

My main intention with Air Quest was to make something that feels personal and engaging, while still being informative. I hope users can learn something about air quality, but also enjoy the process — the little animations, the colors, the playful tone. It’s a simple program, but it reflects how art and technology can overlap in unexpected ways. For me, the most rewarding part was watching something that started as an API request turn into a small digital artwork that reacts and responds.
